# QUICKTYPE – Fast Typing Game
A fast-paced typing challenge built as the final project for our Object Oriented Javascript course.  
This interactive browser game tests typing speed, accuracy, and reaction time — all within a fun 30-second countdown.

## Project Overview
**QUICKTYPE** is a typing-speed game where players must correctly enter randomized words before the timer runs out. The game includes sound effects, background music, animations, score tracking, and the ability to restart without reloading the page.

This project was built by a **team of 3 members**, using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (modules)**.


## How the Game Works
- Click **Start** to begin the countdown animation.  
- Background music begins playing when the game starts.  
- A word appears on the screen — type it exactly and press nothing else (input updates automatically).  
- When a word is typed correctly, the next word appears instantly.  
- You have **30 seconds** to get as many correct words as possible.  
- The game ends when:
  - Time runs out  
  **OR**
  - The player completes all required words.

The game shows:
- Time remaining  
- Current score  
- Words left to complete  
- Live scoreboard with date, time left, and accuracy percentage  

You can restart immediately using the **RESET** button.
